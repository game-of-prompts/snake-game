    Generates the cryptographic commitment for participation in Game of Prompts.

    Args:
        solver_id (str): The solver's identifier (e.g., "my_solver.celaut.bee" or an alias).
                         It will be encoded to UTF-8 bytes.
        score (int): The score obtained by the solver. It will be converted to bytes of an Ergo Long
                     (64-bit, big-endian, signed).
        hash_logs_hex (str): The hash of the game logs, as a hexadecimal string.
                             It must be a 32-byte hash (e.g., Blake2b-256), therefore, a 64-character hex string.
        secret_s_hex (str): The game's secret 'S', as a hexadecimal string.
                            Generally a 256-bit value (64-character hex string).

        str: The resulting commitment C (Blake2b-256 hash) as a hexadecimal string.
